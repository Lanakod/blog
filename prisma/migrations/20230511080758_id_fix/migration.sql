  - The primary key for the `Category` table will be changed. If it partially fails, the table could be left without primary key constraint.
  - The `id` column on the `Category` table would be dropped and recreated. This will lead to data loss if there is data in the column.
  - The primary key for the `Date` table will be changed. If it partially fails, the table could be left without primary key constraint.
  - The `id` column on the `Date` table would be dropped and recreated. This will lead to data loss if there is data in the column.
